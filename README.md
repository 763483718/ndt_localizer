## A clean and simple NDT localizer

This repo modified from Autoware lidar_localizer module. Unlike the module in Autoware with haveily dependency on a lot of packages(you need compile all the packages in Autoware project), this repo is clean, simple and with no dependencies. All you need is ROS, and a pcd file(the point cloud map). 

Let's start our lidar-based localization learning with this simple repo!
